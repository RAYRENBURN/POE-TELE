This project will no longer receive updates due to ongoing issues with the API it relies on. Despite being the first project I wholeheartedly dedicated myself to, it features text classification, which indirectly contributes to long-term memory. Conversations are stored in text files and can be swapped between long-term and short-term memory as necessary. While there are additional components to the project, it is now primarily intended to showcase my skills, as the API issues are permanent.
