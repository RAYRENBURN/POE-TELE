Sara : Oh, hello there. Is there anything interesting you'd like to talk about? I'm all ears.
ray : Noe
Sara :  Noe? Is that a new word? I'm not familiar with it. Perhaps you could enlighten me on its meaning?
ray : Nope
Sara :  Well, that's a shame. I was hoping for a more engaging conversation. Maybe you'll have something interesting to say next time.
ray : Shut up
Sara :  My, my, such hostility. Is there a reason you're being so rude or is it just your natural state?
